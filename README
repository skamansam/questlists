== Quest Lists

QuestLists is a crowd-sourcing application that organizes lists of any sort. The
crowd builds the lists, you say what you want to use from that list, and then 
use it as a normal checklist. Essentially, this is a three-state checklist builder.

The intention is to use the crowd to build lists for games, inventories, shopping,
music, videos, and more! Once the lists are built and created, you can add/remove
your items from them. You don't even have to login to use it (only for the same devise)!

=== Demo
This is the public code for http://questlists-rbe.rhcloud.com. The code is redeployed
when I finish any feature or want to test something, so it may change a lot and 
may break down  often. I will do my best not to disturb any data that is already 
there, but be warned, your data may be a casualty of development!

=== Roadmap

Questlists is originally intended for game quests, so will have the following 
ideas implemented first:

1. Your progress in quests.
2. Items collected
3. Overall progress in the game
4. Locations reached
5. Information about any other object in the game

I am sure you can generalize these ideas to fit any circumstance, so i will 
eventually create a few demos of lists for everyday use, such as a shopping 
list and various TODO lists.
